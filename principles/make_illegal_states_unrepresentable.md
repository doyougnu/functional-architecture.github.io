"Make illegal states unrepresentable" is a mantra commonly used in
functional modeling. The mantra was coined by Yaron Minsky in a [2010
guest lecture at
Harvard.](https://blog.janestreet.com/effective-ml-revisited/) The
idea is to model data representations in such a way that nonsensical
("illegal") values ("states") are inexpressible
("unrepresentable"). By adhering to "Make illegal states
unrepresentable" the resulting models are often simpler, expressing
the desired intent more directly. This leads to systems that are more
robust (often correct by construction) and more loosely coupled.

## Techniques

"Make illegal states unrepresentable" was first introduced by Ron
Minsky in the context of Ocaml, a statically typed language with
explicit support for algebraic data types. The original example
illustrates the mantra by turning a flat product type with many
nullable fields into a sum-of-products. The mantra itself is not
limited to statically typed languages and there are other techniques
to implement the mantra.

### Leveraging sum types

Minsky's original example starts off with the following OCaml code,
which illustrates some subtle data modelling issues.

```ocaml
type connection_state =
| Connecting
| Connected
| Disconnected

type connection_info = {
  state: connection_state;
  server: Inet_addr.t;
  last_ping_time: Time.t option;
  last_ping_id: int option;
  session_id: string option;
  when_initiated: Time.t option;
  when_disconnected: Time.t option;
}
```

With this representation some illegal states can be represented. For
example, we can come up with a `Connecting` state that has a
`when_disconnected` value.

```ocaml
let illegal_1 = {
  state = Connecting;
  when_disconnected = Some some_time;
  ...
}
```

Or we can come up with a `Connected` state that has a `last_ping_time`
but no `last_ping_id`.

```ocaml
let illegal_2 = {
  state = Connected;
  last_ping_time = Some some_time;
  last_ping_id = None;
  ...
}
```

In this representation there are some invariants that aren't captured
by the model, so they have to be adhered to by users of the model,
which introduces implicit coupling. The invariants have to be
described outside of the programming language facilities, for instance
in a comment. These descriptions can get out of sync with
the code. Since the invariants aren't machine checked they are a
common source of bugs.

An improved model that inherently expresses relevant invariants looks like this:

```ocaml
type connecting = { when_initiated: Time.t; }
type connected = { last_ping : (Time.t * int) option;
          session_id: string; }
type disconnected = { when_disconnected: Time.t; }

type connection_state =
| Connecting of connecting
| Connected of connected
| Disconnected of disconnected

type connection_info = {
  state : connection_state;
  server: Inet_addr.t;
}
```

Now `connection_state` is a proper sum-of-products. The fields that
only make sense for one of the three states are now part of the
corresponding type only. The field `server` makes sense for all states
and is therefore part of the larger `connection_info`
type. Additionally, the requirement that `last_ping_time` and
`last_ping_id` are either both `Some ...` or both `None` is now
expressed by `last_ping` being a single option of a tuple.

#### Leveraging sum types in dynamically typed languages

Dynamically typed languages such as Clojure do not explicitly mention
algebraic data types as a language feature. Still, the above technique
of turning a flat product into a sum-of-products can be used in
dynamically typed languages as well. We use Clojure (+
[active-clojure](https://github.com/active-group/active-clojure)
records) to illustrate this point. The flawed representation uses a
flat record as in the Ocaml code above:

```clojure
(define-record-type ConnectionInfo
  make-connection-info
  connection-info?
  [state connection-info-state ;; one of :connecting, :connected, :disconnected
   server connection-info-server ;; non-nullable
   last-ping-time connection-info-last-ping-time ;; nullable
   last-ping-id connection-info-last-ping-id ;; nullable
   session-id connection-info-session-id ;; nullable
   when-initiated connection-info-when-initiated ;; nullable
   when-disconnected connection-info-when-disconnected ;; nullable
   ])
```

This, again, allows for nonsensical values to be representable:

```clojure
(def illegal-1
  (make-connection-info
   ;; connection-state
   :connecting
   ...
   ;; when-disconnected
   some-date))

(def illegal-2
  (make-connection-info
   ;; connection-state
   :connected
   ...
   ;; last-ping-time
   some-date
   ;; last-ping-id
   nil
   ...
   ))
```

A better representation looks quite similar to the improved Ocaml code above:

```clojure
(define-record-type Connecting
  ^:private mk-connecting
  connecting?
  [when connecting-when])

(defn make-connecting [when]
  (assert (date? when))
  (mk-connecting when))

(define-record-type Connected
  ^:private mk-connected
  connected?
  [last-ping connected-last-ping
   session-id connected-session-id])

(define-record-type Ping
  make-ping
  ping?
  [when ping-when
   id ping-id])

(defn make-connected [last-ping session-id]
  (assert (ping? last-ping))
  (assert (session-id? session-id))
  (mk-connected last-ping session-id))

(define-record-type Disconnected
  ^:private mk-disconnected
  disconnected?
  [when disconnected-when])

(defn make-disconnected [when]
  (assert (date? when))
  (mk-disconnected when))

(defn connection-state? [x]
  (or (connecting? x)
      (connected? x)
      (disconnected? x))

(define-record-type ConnectionInfo
  ^:private mk-connection-info
  connection-info?
  [state connection-info-state
   server connection-info-server])

(defn make-connection-info [state server]
  (assert (connection-state? state))
  (assert (inet-addr? server))
  (mk-connection-info state server))
```

Since Clojure doesn't do proper static type checking, the smart
constructor `make-connection-info` above can only check its parameters
at runtime via `assert`. Still, this latter representation is
preferable to the previous one for the same reasons as in the original
Ocaml example.





### Leveraging associative maps and functions
Some domains are best modelled with the help of associative key-value
maps or pure functions.  As an example imagine we want to model the
concept of a time series.  We start with a Scala
representation of time series as a list of time-double-tuples:

```scala
object TimeSeriesService {
  type TimeSeries = List[(Time, Double)]
}
```

This allows for illegal and nonsensical values to be represented:

```scala
// Let t1, t2, t3 be timestamps with t1 < t2 < t3
val ts1 = List((t2, 6.5), (t1, 5.0), (t3, 7.3))
val ts2 = List((t1, 6.5), (t1, 6.5))
val ts3 = List((t1, 6.5), (t1, 13.4))
```

`ts3` is certainly illegal, and `ts1` and `ts2` are surely not the
common case either. A user of the `TimeSeriesService` now has to think
hard about what each these cases denote. A more straightforward model
is to represent time series as associative maps from time to double:

```scala
object TimeSeriesService {
  type TimeSeries = Map[Time, Double]
}
```

Now contradictory or redundant values are inexpressible. An even
better model is time series as functions from time to optional
double:

```scala
sealed trait TS extends Function1[Time, Option[Double]]

object TimeSeriesService {
  type TimeSeries = TS
}
```

This way, time series can be represented by lists, maps, proper
functions, static values, etc, as long as we can make these types
behave like a function:

```scala
class TSList(list: List[(Time, Option[Double])])
    extends TS {

  def apply(t: Time): Option[Double] =
    list.find( (tx, _) => tx == t ).flatMap(_._2)
}

class TSConst(val: Double) extends TS {
  def apply(_: Time): Option[Double] =
    Some(val)
}
```

With this model of time series as functions we made illegal states
unrepresentable and also we made all legal states representable, which
might be just as important.


### Smart constructors

## Architectural impact

"Make illegal states unrepresentable" can have a great impact both for
understanding a software's domain and for the software architecture
itself. Models designed with "Make illegal states unrepresentable" in
mind are simpler and therefore aid in gaining insight into a
domain. Systems using these models are robust and loosely coupled.

### Simplicity

"Make illegal states unrepresentable" leads to simpler models. This
frees the designer's mind from having to deal with arbitrary technical
intracacies of the model. Take the model of time series as functions
of time described above.

```scala
sealed trait TS extends Function1[Time, Option[Double]]
```

There's little you can do with functions, so there's little you can _do
wrong_ with functions.

## Historical context and discussion

"Make illegal states unrepresentable" specifically mentions
"states". In software engineering, "state" usually refers to mutable
state, but Ron Minsky's original example illustrates that in this
context "state" has a different notion. His `connection_state`
describes immutable values. The term "state" hints at the idea that
these values are parts of a state machine. `connection_state` most
likely moves from `Connecting ...` via `Connected ...` to `Disconnected ...`.

"Make illegal states unrepresentable" is applicable to use cases apart
from state machines. A better term would be "Make illegal values
unrepresentable". In addition to values created with sums and
products, the latter would include functions, since functions are
values in functional programming. The idea of "Make illegal values
unrepresentable" would then be equivalent to programming with
machine-checked specifications. Examples of the latter are [How to
