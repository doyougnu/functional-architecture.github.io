	    *** FUNARCH 2024 -- CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ***

		  The First ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
	 Functional Software Architecture - FP in the Large

	       6th September 2024, Milan, Italy
		      Co-located with ICFP 2024

     https://www.functional-architecture.org/events/funarch-2024/

======================================================================

BACKGROUND:

The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Functional Software Architecture - FP
in the Large aims to disseminate and enable the use of functional
programming in the large and long-lived software projects.

We specifically want:

- To assemble a community interested in software architecture
  techniques and technologies specific to functional programming;

- To identify, categorize, and document topics relevant to
  the field of functional software architecture;

- To connect the functional programming community to the software
  architecture community to cross-pollinate between the two.

We'd love for you to be part of this effort.  Whatever your
background, you're welcome at FUNARCH - to listen to talks, report
on your experience, and interact with others that share our goals.

See you at FUNARCH!

REGISTRATION:

You can register for the workshop via the registration page for
the ICFP conference, but there's no need to also register for
the conference.  Reduced fees are available until 5th August.
