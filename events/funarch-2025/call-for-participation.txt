		  The Third ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
	 Functional Software Architecture - FP in the Large

	       17th October 2025, Singapore
		      Co-located with ICFP 2025

======================================================================

BACKGROUND:

The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Functional Software Architecture - FP
in the Large aims to disseminate and enable the use of functional
programming in the large and long-lived software projects.

We specifically want:

- To assemble a community interested in software architecture
  techniques and technologies specific to functional programming;

- To identify, categorize, and document topics relevant to
  the field of functional software architecture;

- To connect the functional programming community to the software
  architecture community to cross-pollinate between the two.

We'd love for you to be part of this effort.  Whatever your
background, you're welcome at FUNARCH - to listen to talks, report
on your experience, and interact with others that share our goals.

See you at FUNARCH!
