---

"Functional Software Architecture" refers to methods of construction
and structure of large and long-lived software projects that are
implemented in functional languages and released to real users,
typically in industry.

The goals for the workshop are:

- To assemble a community interested in software architecture
  techniques and technologies specific to functional programming;

- To identify, categorize, and document topics relevant to
  the field of functional software architecture;

- To connect the functional programming community to the software
  architecture community to cross-pollinate between the two.

FUNARCH 2025 will be co-colocated with [ICFP 2025](https://icfp25.sigplan.org/)
in Singapore on October 17th 2025.
